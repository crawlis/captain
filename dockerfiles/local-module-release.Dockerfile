# This image should be used to:
#   - Run the microservice you are developping
#   - Run it in release mode
#
# This is a development dockerfile optimized to :
#   - Reduce the build time: non-project binaries are cached
#   - Reduce the image space: the project is installed as a binary runnable from scratch image
